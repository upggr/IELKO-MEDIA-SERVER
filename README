Media server - wowza , nimble killer :)

Run the following commands on a freshly installed Ubuntu 14 or 15 Server on digital ocean
sudo -s
apt-get install curl -y
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upggr/IELKO-MEDIA-SERVER/master/install_new.sh | sudo bash -


If port 80 is not available for the wan and you want to NAT it, try this :
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upggr/IELKO-MEDIA-SERVER/master/nginx-8088.sh | sudo bash -
This will use port 8088 for all the video references. This way you can have your LAN server on 80 and point wan from 8088 to 80


If you need to get the latest version of the interface run : /etc/cron.daily/refreshwww
There is a daily cron for this.
